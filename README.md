This project is based on a Udemy course by Angela Yu. It involves creating a responsive website using HTML5 and Bootstrap, featuring sections for features, testimonials, and pricing. Bootstrap classes are utilized for easy styling, ensuring a clean and modern design.

In addition, custom CSS is applied to enhance the visual appeal. A vibrant gradient background is created using a linear gradient that transitions smoothly between colors, animated to provide a dynamic effect.
